# BIG_DATA_PREDICTION
 
In this data mining project we have a big data file with something about more than 7000 numbers which the file name is ('data.pdf') and we have to use these numbers and  suitable related libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and some other libraries to predict 10 to 20 further level.

All the requierments are imported no more thing is needed to add.
